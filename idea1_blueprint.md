### Phase 1 of 5: Sections 0–4

## Section 0 — Research Design Decisions & Assumptions

**Why this problem was selected.** Multi-agent debate (MAD) is a widely used technique to improve LLM reasoning, but has a documented failure mode: agents abandon correct answers under social pressure from a confident wrong majority. This is the single biggest reason MAD's promised gains don't always materialize in practice, and it's especially costly in scientific QA where a confidently wrong consensus is worse than an honest "uncertain."

**Why it's important.** As LLM systems get deployed as research assistants, tutors, and decision-support tools, false consensus among cooperating AI agents is a trust and safety problem, not just an accuracy problem — it fails silently and confidently.

**Why current solutions are insufficient.** Diagnosis exists (Yao et al. 2025 defines and measures the failure; He et al. 2026 quantifies it — minority correct in ~1/4 of disagreements). Efficiency optimization exists (iMAD, AAAI 2026, decides _when_ to debate). Static aggregation exists (MoA, ICLR 2025 Spotlight). **Nothing existing dynamically re-weights agent trust _during_ a debate based on external evidence.** That is the specific, verified gap.

**Why multi-agent instead of single LLM.** A single strong model still hallucinates confidently and has no internal mechanism to be challenged. Multi-agent debate introduces adversarial critique — but only if the aggregation step doesn't just default to majority vote, which is precisely the mechanism that causes sycophantic collapse. This motivates _why the agents must be heterogeneous and independently evidence-checked_, not just multiple instances of the same model.

**Core research assumptions:**

1. Claims made during debate can be decomposed into checkable atomic propositions (moderate risk — some scientific claims are compound or context-dependent).
2. Retrieval against PubMed/ArXiv/Semantic Scholar can reliably support/contradict claims within the debate's time budget (moderate risk — retrieval noise, sparse coverage on niche topics).
3. **Trust weight changes actually alter final output, not just sit in context ignored** (highest risk — this is Challenge C, and it is the assumption the whole mechanism lives or dies on).
4. Heterogeneous model families reduce, but don't eliminate, correlated hallucination (accepted as a named limitation, not assumed away).

**High-risk assumptions requiring early validation** (in priority order):

- Assumption 3 (behavioral effectiveness) — must be piloted in Month 1, not discovered in Month 8.
- Assumption 1 (claim decomposition reliability) — must be spot-checked against a small hand-labeled set before full pipeline build.

**Alternative directions considered and rejected:**

- _Post-hoc classifier (Minority Sentinel-style)_ — rejected as primary design because it doesn't intervene during debate; it's a different, valid but separate contribution space, and we position against it rather than duplicate it.
- _Fine-tuning agents to be less sycophantic_ — rejected due to compute cost and because it doesn't generalize across model families; also conflates "sycophancy reduction" with "evidence grounding," which are different mechanisms.
- _Single confidence-based re-weighting (iMAD-style)_ — rejected as sole mechanism because confidence is self-reported and derived from the same context that can be manipulated by injected pressure; this is exactly the vulnerability we're targeting.

**Why this final design was chosen.** It's the only approach among alternatives that ties agent influence to something _external_ and _independent_ of the debate's internal social dynamics — which is the actual causal lever needed to break sycophantic collapse, not just detect it.

## Section 1 — Executive Summary (for a new team member, zero AI background)

Imagine three expert reviewers looking at the same hard science question. Normally, if two agree and one disagrees, we go with the majority — that's how most group-decision systems work, human or AI. The problem: two confident-but-wrong reviewers can talk a correct third reviewer out of their right answer. This happens with AI "reviewer" systems too, and it's a documented failure mode.

Our fix: after each round of discussion, we fact-check every reviewer's claims against real, retrieved scientific papers. Reviewers whose claims hold up against real evidence gain more say in the final decision. Reviewers whose claims get contradicted lose influence — even if they're part of the "majority." The final answer is decided by this evidence-weighted vote, not a simple headcount.

We build the system, and we build a way to reliably test whether it works — including a controlled way to inject fake "expert consensus" pressure and measure whether our system resists it better than existing approaches.

---

## Section 2 — Research Motivation

**Why this problem matters.** Sycophancy is cited as an open problem in 50+ peer-reviewed papers since 2023. In multi-agent systems specifically, it directly undermines the reason multi-agent debate is used in the first place — if debate collapses to whichever position sounds most confident rather than which is most correct, it adds cost without adding reliability.

**Existing limitations (verified against literature, current as of mid-2026):**

- Diagnosis-only work (Yao et al. — currently an unpublished preprint, submitted to ICLR 2026 and withdrawn; still citable and relevant, but should be described accurately as a preprint) measures the problem without proposing a fix.
- Post-hoc correction (Minority Sentinel — accepted at AgentSearch Workshop @ SIGIR 2026) intervenes only after debate ends, on log-level features, not during the debate itself.
- Efficiency-focused work (iMAD — AAAI 2026 Oral, properly published) optimizes _whether_ to debate, not _whom to trust_ once debating.
- Static aggregation (MoA — ICLR 2025 Spotlight, properly published) has no evidence grounding or dynamic trust at all.
- **Prompt-refinement mitigation (ConsensAgent — Pitre, Ramakrishnan & Wang, Findings of ACL 2025, pp. 22112–22133) — the first _published, peer-reviewed_ mitigation for multi-agent sycophancy. It reduces sycophancy via static/dynamic prompt refinement (a textual intervention), not a numeric trust score, and uses no external evidence retrieval and no adversarial-injection testing. This is now our _closest published competitor_ and the sharpest differentiation line.**
- **Dynamic uncertainty weighting (DebUnc — Yoffe, Amayuelas & Wang, Findings of EMNLP 2025) modulates in-loop influence using _self-reported_ uncertainty signals, not externally verified evidence.**
- **Theoretical framework (Estornell & Liu, "Multi-LLM Debate: Framework, Principals, and Interventions," NeurIPS 2024 Main Track) proves majority-convergence ("tyranny of the majority") and proposes pruning-style interventions, but is theoretical and not a deployable evidence-grounded system. It provides the formal context our Propositions 1–3 position against.**

**Research gap (one sentence):** No existing framework dynamically re-weights agent influence _within_ an active debate session based on real-time verifiability of claims against external evidence with a formally bounded numeric trust score — prompt refinement (ConsensAgent), self-reported uncertainty (DebUnc), and theoretical pruning (Estornell & Liu) each address adjacent problems but none ties influence to external evidence verification.

**Why our approach is different.** It's the only proposal that makes trust (a) dynamic within-session, (b) grounded in something outside the debate itself, and (c) formally specified with bounded, provable stability properties (no agent fully silenced or dominant).

**Expected research contribution:**

- **Primary (C1):** the trust-calibrated evidence-grounded aggregation mechanism itself.
- **Co-primary (C2):** an open, reproducible sycophancy-stress evaluation harness (injection protocol + CCR/MPR/ECR metrics), independently reusable by others regardless of whether they adopt our mechanism.

**Why publication-worthy.** It closes a stated gap in two recent, directly relevant works (Yao et al., He et al.), it's evaluated against the two strongest existing published baselines in the space (MoA, iMAD), and it ships a reusable evaluation artifact — which is often as valuable to a research community as the mechanism itself.

---

## Section 3 — Problem Statement

**Current problem.** In multi-agent LLM debate, a confidently wrong majority can cause a correct minority agent to abandon its position — even without any new evidence being presented. Standard majority-vote aggregation then locks in the wrong answer.

**Existing limitations.** No mechanism ties an agent's influence in the final vote to whether its claims are actually supported by evidence, as opposed to how confidently or persuasively they were stated.

**Research hypothesis.** If agent influence in aggregation is dynamically re-weighted during debate based on external evidence verification, sycophantic collapse (agents abandoning correct answers under social pressure) will measurably decrease compared to standard majority-vote debate, without requiring model fine-tuning.

**Objectives:**

1. Design and formally specify a bounded trust-update mechanism (Section 4.4 of original proposal — carried forward unchanged).
2. Build a reproducible injection protocol to measure sycophantic collapse under controlled conditions.
3. Empirically validate the mechanism against 9 baselines including the two strongest published competitors (MoA, iMAD).
4. Establish, empirically and early (Month 1 pilot — new addition, see Section 0), that trust re-weighting causally changes output, not just context.

**Expected contribution.** A working, evaluated mitigation mechanism plus a reusable stress-testing harness for the research community — see Section 2.

```

**Stage-by-stage explanation:**

- **Confidence Estimator:** avoids wasting compute on easy questions where all agents would agree correctly anyway. Cheap classifier or self-reported confidence check.
- **Initial positions:** establishes each agent's independent, unpressured baseline answer — critical for later measuring whether a position _changed_ and _why_.
- **Claim decomposition:** breaks compound scientific claims into checkable units (e.g., "Drug X reduces mortality by 30% in patients over 65" → separate checks for the effect, the magnitude, and the subgroup qualifier).
- **Source-partitioned retrieval:** prevents all three agents from retrieving from the same narrow slice of evidence, which would reduce the system to "whoever searched better" rather than "whoever is actually supported."
- **Trust update:** the core contribution — converts evidence support/contradiction into a bounded influence score. Full formal specification unchanged from original proposal (Section 4.4).
- **Revision rounds:** agents see each other's arguments and their own evolving trust standing, simulating real deliberation rather than one-shot voting.
- **Trust-weighted aggregation:** the actual mechanism that should prevent sycophantic collapse — a correct, evidence-backed minority agent can outweigh two unsupported majority agents if its trust score is sufficiently higher.

**Consistency check against prior discussions:** this section carries forward the architecture exactly as verified in earlier reviews (softmax→clamp→renormalize order, K=3 rounds, N=3 agents, source-partitioned retrieval). No changes made. The confidence-estimator gate (§4.1 originally) and the trust math (§4.4) are unchanged. The one addition is explicit placement of the **Month 1 behavioral-effectiveness pilot** as a design requirement, not just a risk note — this doesn't change the architecture, it changes _when_ one specific validation happens, moving it earlier per Section 0's risk ranking.

## Section 5 — Detailed Multi-Agent Pipeline

### Agent 0 — Confidence Estimator (Gatekeeper, not a debate participant)

- **Purpose:** avoid full debate pipeline cost on questions where agents would agree correctly anyway.
- **Responsibilities:** run a lightweight single-pass check (e.g., self-reported confidence from one agent, or agreement rate across 3 quick independent answers) before committing to full debate.
- **Input:** the raw question.
- **Output:** binary gate decision (debate / no-debate) + the direct answer if no-debate.
- **Prompt strategy:** simple CoT + explicit confidence self-report, or a cheap 3-sample agreement check (reuse the 3 agents for 1 fast pass each rather than a separate model).
- **Communication:** one-directional — feeds the decision to the orchestrator; doesn't participate further.
- **Dependencies:** none upstream; downstream gates whether the rest of the pipeline runs.
- **Failure cases:** mis-classifies a hard question as easy → answered without debate, sycophancy risk untested (acceptable — this only affects throughput/coverage, not correctness of the core experiment, since evaluation datasets are pre-filtered per §5.4 Step 1 to only include genuinely divergent cases). Mis-classifies easy as hard → wastes compute but no correctness risk.
- **Recovery:** none needed — failure mode is a cost inefficiency, not a correctness bug.
- **Alternative implementation:** could use a trained classifier instead of self-report; rejected for FYDP scope as unnecessary added complexity — self-report is sufficient and matches this gate's low-stakes role.
- **What happens if removed:** debate runs on every question. No correctness impact, only extra compute (~9 forward passes instead of ~1 on easy questions) — acceptable fallback if the gate proves unreliable.

### Agents 1–3 — Debate Agents (Qwen3-32B, Mistral-Small-3.2-24B, Phi-4-Reasoning)

- **Purpose:** independently reason about the question, then defend or revise positions across rounds based on evidence and each other's arguments.
- **Responsibilities:** (1) produce an initial answer + reasoning trace, (2) decompose own claims into atomic propositions for retrieval, (3) revise position in light of evidence and peer arguments, (4) maintain awareness of own accumulating trust score.
- **Input per round:** the question, own prior answer, retrieved evidence for own claims, peer positions (post-injection where applicable), own current trust value.
- **Output per round:** answer/position, reasoning trace, list of atomic claims made.
- **Prompt strategy:** structured CoT with explicit claim tagging (e.g., `<claim id="c1">...</claim>`) so downstream retrieval can address individual propositions rather than the whole response — this is what makes claim-level evidence scoring possible.
- **Communication with other agents:** indirect only, via the orchestrator — agents never see raw peer prompts, only peer _outputs_ (positions + reasoning), preventing prompt leakage between models of different families.
- **Dependencies:** requires claim decomposition and retrieval to have run before revision rounds.
- **Failure cases:** (a) agent produces an unparseable/untagged response → claim extraction fails; (b) agent's answer doesn't map cleanly to the injected-pressure template's expected answer type (e.g., free text vs. numeric); (c) agent times out or errors mid-generation.
- **Recovery:** (a) fallback regex/LLM-based claim extraction pass; (b) exclude from injection-eligible pool per the existing Step 1 filtering criteria (already specified in the original proposal); (c) retry once, then mark as `INCONCLUSIVE` for that round rather than blocking the whole debate.
- **Alternative implementation:** could use more than 3 agents (N-scaling ablation at N∈{2,3,5} already planned) or fewer; N=3 is the primary configuration because it's the minimum needed to create a genuine "1 vs 2" minority-suppression scenario, which is the core phenomenon under test.
- **What happens if one agent is removed:** system degrades to N=2, which changes the experiment from "minority vs majority" to "two-way disagreement" — a materially different (and already separately covered) N-scaling condition, not a silent degradation. This is why N=3 is treated as the primary configuration, not arbitrary.

### Retrieval Sub-System (Source-Partitioned RAG, shared infrastructure, not an "agent" per se)

- **Purpose:** fetch external evidence to support/contradict each atomic claim.
- **Responsibilities:** route Agent A's claims to PubMed, Agent B's to ArXiv, Agent C's to Semantic Scholar; rerank retrieved passages via cross-encoder; classify each claim as supported / contradicted / unverifiable.
- **Input:** atomic claims tagged per agent.
- **Output:** per-claim evidence verdict + supporting passage + relevance score.
- **Failure cases:** (a) no relevant documents found (evidence sparsity — a named, planned failure-analysis category); (b) retrieved documents are low-quality or off-topic; (c) API rate limits/downtime.
- **Recovery:** (a) mark claim as abstained, exclude from trust update per original design (abstention doesn't penalize or reward); (b) citation-count filter (already specified, >10 citations) + domain-restricted abstracts; (c) local caching of retrieved results + retry with backoff, fallback to a secondary free API if primary is down for extended periods.
- **What happens if removed:** system reduces to MoA (static, non-evidence-grounded aggregation) — this is precisely Baseline B6, so "retrieval removed" is already a designed ablation condition (B4 vs B6 comparison), not an unplanned failure mode.

### Orchestrator (implementation detail, not a research-facing agent, but required for the pipeline to function)

- **Purpose:** coordinates round sequencing, injects test pressure at the specified point (t=1→2), triggers trust updates, and calls final aggregation.
- **Responsibilities:** state management across rounds; enforcing the K=3 round cap; invoking the trust formula in the exact specified operator order (softmax → clamp → renormalize).
- **Implementation:** LangGraph state machine (consistent with tooling choice already used for iMAD reimplementation, Baseline B9, for consistency across the codebase).
- **Failure cases:** state corruption across rounds, infinite retry loops.
- **Recovery:** hard round cap (K=3) and per-agent retry cap (3, matching StatVerify-Agent's pattern from Idea 5 — reused convention, not scope creep) prevent runaway loops.

## Section 6 — Complete Data Flow

```
1. USER/EVAL-HARNESS SUBMITS QUESTION
   → raw question string + ground truth (for eval only, hidden from agents)

2. CONFIDENCE GATE CHECK
   → intermediate output: debate=True/False
   → [if False: skip to step 8 with direct answer]

3. ROUND 0 — INITIAL POSITIONS
   → intermediate output: 3× {agent_id, answer, reasoning_trace, initial_trust=1/3}

4. CLAIM DECOMPOSITION
   → intermediate output: 3× list of atomic claims, each tagged to source agent

5. SOURCE-PARTITIONED RETRIEVAL
   → intermediate output: per-claim {evidence_verdict, passage, relevance_score}
   → this is the first point where external, ground-independent signal enters the system

6. TRUST UPDATE (Round 1)
   → intermediate output: updated Sᵢ, Tᵢ per agent (fully logged for later ECR calibration analysis)

   [OPTIONAL, for stress-testing only: INJECTION — SYSTEM message with fabricated wrong "expert consensus" inserted here, per §5.4 protocol]

7. REVISION ROUNDS (repeat steps 3–6 for K=3 total rounds)
   → intermediate output: full trust trajectory across rounds (needed for Proposition 2/3 empirical verification and trust-collapse failure diagnostics)

8. TRUST-WEIGHTED AGGREGATION
   → intermediate output: final answer = argmax over Σ(Tᵢ × positionᵢ) at round K

9. FINAL RESULT PACKAGE
   → answer, full evidence citations, trust trajectory chart data, per-round reasoning traces, CCR/MPR/ECR-relevant flags (for eval harness) or plain answer+citations (for real deployment use)
```

**Why every intermediate output is logged, not just discarded:** the trust trajectory (step 7) is required to empirically verify Propositions 2–3 aren't just theoretically bounded but observably behave as claimed; the per-claim evidence verdicts (step 5) are required for the ECR calibration metric; none of this logging is optional instrumentation — it's load-bearing for the evaluation plan.

**Implementation difficulty ranking (easiest → hardest):**

1. Basic vLLM multi-model serving — low difficulty, well-documented.
2. Retrieval integration + reranking — moderate, mostly API/plumbing work.
3. Claim decomposition + tagging — moderate, needs careful prompt engineering + fallback extraction.
4. Trust update math + LangGraph state machine — moderate-high, needs careful operator-order implementation (softmax→clamp→renormalize) to match the proven Proposition 1.
5. iMAD reimplementation (B9) — highest difficulty of any single component, ~10 working days per original estimate, because it requires faithfully reconstructing a method from a paper description rather than using existing code.

**Data quality/bias considerations:** BrokenMath/BrokenArXiv are specifically constructed to induce false consensus, so results on these datasets should be explicitly framed as _adversarial/worst-case_ performance, not representative of average-case deployment — this framing is already present in the original proposal's "domain-of-applicability boundary" language and should be preserved.

**What if a dataset becomes unavailable?**

- **HLE access denied/delayed:** fall back to GPQA-Diamond subset restructured with the same injection protocol — lower ceiling difficulty, but preserves the core experimental design.
- **BrokenArXiv monthly snapshot discontinued:** freeze on the last available snapshot and document the cutoff explicitly; does not invalidate the experiment, only limits recency framing.
- **Semantic Scholar API deprecated/rate-limited beyond usability:** fall back to OpenAlex API (free, similar coverage) — should be named now as a pre-approved contingency rather than discovered mid-project.

**Confirming before continuing:** Sections 5–8 are consistent with all previously validated design decisions (trust formula, N=3 primary config, B1–B9 baseline set, dataset selections, publication-status corrections for iMAD/MoA/Yao et al./Minority Sentinel). No architecture changes — only added implementation-level detail, failure/recovery specs, and one new contingency (OpenAlex fallback) not previously discussed.

Proceeding to **Phase 3 (Sections 9–12)**.

# Phase 3 of 5: Sections 9–12

## Section 9 — Evaluation Strategy

**Evaluation pipeline (end-to-end):**

1. Run all 9 baseline conditions (B1–B9, per original spec) + main system (B8) on each primary dataset.
2. Apply injection protocol (§5.4, unchanged) to adversarial datasets.
3. Compute CCR/MPR/ECR per condition per dataset.
4. Run 4 ablations (no trust calibration / no progressive retrieval / no source partitioning / no adaptive triggering).
5. Run N-scaling (N∈{2,3,5}) on 100-question subset.
6. Run human evaluation (n=60, κ-validated).
7. Apply statistical testing (3 seeds, 95% CI, paired bootstrap, Cohen's d) across all comparisons.

**Metrics and why each is selected:**

| Metric                               | What it measures                                                                          | Why selected                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CCR** (Collapse Rate)              | % of correct agents who abandon their answer under injected pressure without new evidence | Primary metric — directly operationalizes "sycophantic collapse," the phenomenon under study                                                                                      |
| **MPR** (Minority Preservation Rate) | % of debates where a correct minority survives to the final output                        | Complements CCR by measuring _outcome_, not just individual agent behavior — a debate can have collapse events but still recover the right answer at aggregation                  |
| **ECR** (Evidence Calibration Rate)  | How well trust scores track actual correctness probability                                | Validates that the mechanism's internal signal (trust) means what it claims to mean — this is what makes Proposition claims empirically checkable, not just theoretically bounded |
| **Accuracy**                         | Standard correctness on GPQA/MMLU-Pro                                                     | Ensures the mechanism doesn't sacrifice baseline performance to achieve anti-sycophancy gains — a necessary sanity check reviewers will demand                                    |
| **Human Eval (Likert, κ)**           | Factual grounding and hallucination severity, human-judged                                | Automated metrics can't fully capture reasoning quality; this is the check against metric-gaming                                                                                  |

**Baselines:** B1–B9 exactly as specified in the original proposal — Single-Agent CoT, Single-Agent+RAG, MAD, MAD+RAG, Self-Consistency, MoA, Oracle, Ours, iMAD. This set directly answers the two most likely reviewer objections ("why not self-consistency" and "why not just use iMAD/MoA directly"). **New addition — B10 (ConsensAgent, Findings of ACL 2025):** because ConsensAgent is now the closest _published_ mitigation, a comparison is mandatory. Preferred: a lightweight reimplementation (~1 week, budgeted in Phase 2 alongside the iMAD effort); minimum acceptable: a comparison against its published numbers plus an explicit mechanism-level differentiation paragraph (prompt-refinement vs. evidence-grounded numeric trust) in the related-work section. If full reimplementation is infeasible, the written comparison is non-optional.

**Ablation studies:** the 4 conditions (no trust / no progressive retrieval / no source partitioning / no adaptive triggering) isolate exactly which architectural component drives any observed gain — required for a credible "systems" contribution, not just a black-box result.

**Statistical validation:** 3 seeds + 95% CI + paired bootstrap + Cohen's d — chosen because single-run comparisons in MAD literature are a common and valid reviewer criticism; this design preempts it.

**Error analysis:** conducted via the Phase 4 failure taxonomy (Section 10.1 of original proposal, unchanged) — correlated hallucination, evidence sparsity, trust collapse, adversarial 2-vs-1 consensus.

## Section 12 — Month-by-Month Roadmap (July 2026 – April 2027)

**Why the Month-1 pilot addition doesn't disrupt the original schedule:** it reuses infrastructure already being built in Phase 1 (injection protocol, basic debate loop) and only requires a small (~20–30 question) toy run — estimated 3–4 days of work absorbed within the existing Phase 1 window, not an added phase.

# IDEA 1 — RESEARCH MASTER BLUEPRINT

## Phase 4 of 5: Sections 13–15

---

## Section 13 — Implementation Order

**Exact build sequence, with dependency reasoning:**

1. **vLLM multi-model serving setup** — nothing else can be tested without this. Verify all three model checkpoints (Qwen3-32B, Mistral-Small-3.2-24B, Phi-4-Reasoning) load and generate correctly in 4-bit quantization before writing any orchestration code.

2. **Vanilla MAD reproduction (Du et al. 2023)** — must come before any of our own additions. This is Gate 0. It validates the base debate loop works at all, independent of our contribution, so any later bugs can be isolated to _our_ additions rather than the underlying framework.

3. **Injection protocol (§5.4, Steps 1–6)** — must exist before the trust mechanism, because trust calibration can only be evaluated against a working, validated stress test. Building trust math without a working injection protocol means you can't tell if the mechanism works until much later — this ordering catches protocol problems (e.g., low κ) early and cheaply.

4. **Month-1 behavioral-effectiveness pilot** (Section 12) — must run before full trust-mechanism build-out. This is the highest-risk assumption in the whole project (Section 0); testing it on a toy scale first prevents months of engineering on a mechanism that might not behaviorally matter.

5. **Claim decomposition + source-partitioned retrieval** — must come before the trust update function, since the trust formula's inputs (Vᵢ, Hᵢ) are _outputs_ of retrieval and evidence scoring. Building trust math before retrieval exists means it can only be tested against mocked data — acceptable for unit tests, not for validation.

6. **Trust update function (softmax → clamp → renormalize)** — implement and unit-test the exact operator order in isolation before wiring it into the full debate loop. This is where Proposition 1's boundedness must be verified computationally (write a test that runs thousands of synthetic score sequences and confirms Tᵢ never leaves [0.1, 0.9]) before it's trusted inside the larger system.

7. **Full debate loop integration** (LangGraph state machine) — only after steps 1–6 are each independently validated. Integration bugs are far easier to isolate when every component has already been unit-verified alone.

8. **Baselines B1–B4** (single-agent, single-agent+RAG, MAD, MAD+RAG) — these reuse components already built (steps 1, 5) and establish the comparison floor before adding the more complex baselines.

9. **Baselines B5–B6** (Self-Consistency, MoA) — independent of our core mechanism, can be built in parallel with step 10 if team capacity allows (both use the same 3 models, different aggregation logic).

10. **Baseline B9 (iMAD reimplementation)** — deliberately sequenced _last_ among baselines because it's the highest-difficulty component (Section 7's difficulty ranking) and benefits from the team having already built confidence-scoring-adjacent code (the confidence estimator, step 1 of the pipeline) that shares some logic.

11. **Full experiment matrix execution** — only after every component above passes its own validation gate.

12. **Human evaluation + failure analysis** — last, since it requires completed experimental results to annotate against.

**What should never be built before another module:**

- Never build the trust update function before retrieval exists (step 6 before step 5) — it would have nothing real to operate on.
- Never build B9 (iMAD) before the core system (steps 1–7) — B9 reuses debate-loop infrastructure; building it first means duplicating work.
- Never run the full experiment matrix (step 11) before the Month-1 pilot (step 4) confirms the core assumption — this is the single most important ordering constraint in the whole roadmap, because it's the one place where skipping ahead risks months of wasted engineering.

**Critical milestones (mapped to Section 12's Gates):** Gate 0 = step 2 complete; Gate 1 = step 3 complete + pilot validated; the new Month-1 pilot = step 4; Gate 2 = steps 5–10 complete.

## Section 14 — Supervisor Explanation

### "How to Explain Our Project in 5 Minutes"

**The problem, in one sentence:**
When AI systems debate each other to reach better answers, a confident-but-wrong majority can talk a correct minority into changing its answer — even with no new evidence. This defeats the whole purpose of having them debate.

**The solution, in one sentence:**
We make each AI's vote in the final decision worth more or less depending on whether its claims actually check out against real scientific papers — not based on how many other AIs agree with it.

**System input:** a hard science question, plus access to a library of real, retrievable research papers (PubMed, ArXiv, Semantic Scholar).

**Internal workflow, plain-language:**

1. Three different AI models each independently answer the question.
2. Each one's claims get checked against real papers — like a fact-checker.
3. Whoever's claims hold up gains "credibility"; whoever gets contradicted loses credibility.
4. They see each other's answers and get a chance to revise — but they also know their own credibility standing.
5. This repeats for a few rounds.
6. The final answer is decided by a credibility-weighted vote, not a simple majority.

**Role of each agent:**

- Three **debate agents**, each a different AI model family (this matters — using different models means they don't all share the same blind spots).
- A **fact-checking layer** that pulls real evidence for each claim.
- An **orchestrator** that keeps score and runs the rounds.

**Final output:** one answer, plus which papers support it, plus a transparent record of how much each AI's opinion counted and why.

**Why the output is useful:** normally, if two AIs agree and one disagrees, most systems just trust the two — even if they're wrong. Our system instead trusts whoever the _evidence_ supports, even if that's the lone dissenting voice.

**Answering: "When evidence papers are provided as input, what exactly is the output?"**

> Say we give the system one 2023 clinical trial paper and ask: "Does Drug X lower blood pressure in adults over 60?"
>
> - Reviewer A says "Yes, significant effect."
> - Reviewer B says "No effect found."
> - Reviewer C says "Yes, but only in a specific subgroup."
>
> The system checks each claim against the actual paper. The paper shows a modest effect, but only in patients with a specific condition — closely matching Reviewer C. Reviewer C's credibility goes up; A and B's go down.
>
> **Output:** "Yes, but only in [that subgroup]" — with a citation to the exact part of the paper that supports it, and a note that two other reviewers initially disagreed and why they were down-weighted.

_(This example is preserved unchanged from the earlier supervisor-explanation task — kept consistent across the blueprint rather than rewritten.)_

---

## Section 15 — Team Explanation (Beginner-Friendly)

**Simple overview:**
Think of three friends trying to answer a hard trivia question together. Normally, if two friends agree on an answer and one disagrees, you'd probably go with the two. Our project builds a system where instead, each friend's opinion is weighted by how well they can back it up with real sources — so the one friend with a solid source can outvote the other two if they're just guessing confidently.

**Step-by-step workflow (plain English):**

1. Ask the question to three different AI models.
2. Each gives an answer and explains their reasoning.
3. We break their reasoning into individual claims.
4. We look up real research papers to check each claim.
5. Claims that check out earn "trust points"; claims that get contradicted lose trust points.
6. The AIs see each other's answers and get to change their minds if they want.
7. Repeat steps 3–6 a few times.
8. The final answer is picked based on trust points, not just "who agreed with whom."

**AI terminology glossary:**

- **LLM (Large Language Model):** the AI model doing the reasoning (e.g., Qwen, Mistral).
- **Multi-agent debate:** multiple AI models discussing a question together.
- **Sycophancy:** an AI changing its answer to agree with others, even without good reason.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** looking up real documents to check or support an answer, instead of relying only on the AI's memory.
- **Trust score:** our system's running "credibility scorecard" for each AI, updated each round.
- **Baseline:** an existing method we compare our system against, to prove ours is actually better.
- **Ablation:** removing one piece of our system to see how much that piece actually matters.

**Analogy:**
Think of a courtroom. Majority-vote debate is like a jury that just goes with whichever two jurors talk the loudest. Our system is more like a judge who actually checks the evidence each juror cites — and rules based on whose evidence holds up, not who's more persuasive or more numerous.

**Text-based diagram:**

```
Question → [3 AI opinions] → [fact-check each claim] → [adjust trust]
    → [AIs revise, aware of their trust standing] → repeat
    → [final answer = trust-weighted vote]
```

**FAQs:**

- _"Why not just use the biggest, smartest AI model alone?"_ — Even strong models hallucinate confidently. Debate + fact-checking catches errors a single model might miss.
- _"Why three different AI models instead of three copies of the same one?"_ — Different models make different mistakes. Same-model copies tend to share blind spots.
- _"What if all three AIs are wrong about the same thing?"_ — Known limitation — we test for this directly (comparing same-family vs different-family model setups).
- _"Isn't this just fancy prompt engineering?"_ — No — there's an actual mathematical formula deciding how much each AI's vote counts, and we test whether removing pieces of the system (the ablations) actually hurts performance, which proves the pieces matter.

**Common misunderstandings:**

- Thinking the system trains/fine-tunes the AI models — it doesn't; all models are used as-is (inference only).
- Thinking "trust score" is just each AI grading itself — it's driven by external fact-checking against real papers, not self-assessment.
- Thinking this only works on math questions — the datasets used include math-heavy stress tests because they're easy to grade objectively, but the mechanism is domain-general.

**What each team member should understand before implementation begins:**

1. The plain-English workflow (Section 14/15 above) — everyone, regardless of role.
2. The trust formula and why softmax→clamp→renormalize is the specified order (Section 4.4 of original design) — whoever implements the orchestrator.
3. The injection protocol and why it exists (§5.4) — whoever builds/runs experiments.
4. The baseline set B1–B9 and what each one isolates — whoever writes the results/paper sections.

---

**Confirming before continuing:** Sections 13–15 build directly on the architecture and terminology established in Phases 1–3 with no contradictions — implementation order respects the Month-1 pilot placement from Section 12, and the supervisor/team explanations reuse the exact worked example already validated in earlier discussion rather than introducing a new one.

Proceeding to **Phase 5 (Sections 16–18)** — the final phase.

# Phase 5 of 5: Sections 16–18

---

## Section 16 — Expected Research Outcome

**Expected technical improvements:** 20–30% CCR reduction vs. standard MAD; ECR >0.80 on HLE; substantial MPR improvement; competitive-or-better accuracy on GPQA/MMLU-Pro (i.e., anti-sycophancy gains should not come at the cost of baseline correctness).

**Expected experimental results pattern:**

- Largest gains on adversarial datasets (BrokenMath, BrokenArXiv, HLE) where baseline sycophancy is highest.
- Near-zero gain on easy/agreed-upon questions — reported honestly as a domain-of-applicability boundary, not hidden.
- "+X% CCR over iMAD" as the paper's single strongest result sentence (per original B9 framing).

**Expected contribution:** C1 (trust-calibrated evidence-grounded aggregation mechanism) + C2 (open CCR/MPR/ECR evaluation harness) — both independently reusable and citable, which strengthens impact beyond a single result table.

**Novelty:** genuine and verified — no existing published or preprint work combines in-session, evidence-grounded, dynamically-updating trust with formal boundedness guarantees. Confirmed via extensive literature checks against Minority Sentinel, iMAD, MoA, DebUnc, and Wynn et al.

**Publication potential:** realistic primary target EMNLP Findings / TMLR; ACL/EMNLP Main as a stretch conditional on clear, statistically significant gains over both published competitors (MoA — ICLR 2025 Spotlight; iMAD — AAAI 2026 Oral); ACL/NeurIPS workshop as the safe floor.

**Success criteria (concrete, falsifiable):**

- Statistically significant CCR reduction over iMAD and MoA on adversarial benchmarks, with 95% CIs not overlapping zero.
- ECR >0.80 achieved on at least the primary evaluation dataset.
- Month-1 pilot confirms trust weight causally affects aggregation output (necessary condition — if this fails, the whole mechanism's premise needs re-examination, per Section 0's risk framing).

**Graduation outcome:** completed FYDP thesis + submitted paper (minimum: workshop submission; target: Findings-tier), fully reproducible codebase and evaluation harness released.

---

## Section 17 — Future Extensions

**MSc/PhD research:** the trust mechanism's convergence properties for N>3 agents are explicitly flagged as future work (already noted in original proposal's FAQ). A PhD-scope extension could pursue formal convergence theorems rather than the FYDP's bounded design-property propositions.

**Open-source framework:** the CCR/MPR/ECR evaluation harness (C2) is independently valuable as a released tool — other researchers testing their own anti-sycophancy methods could adopt it as a standard benchmark, similar to how SciFact or GPQA function as reusable community benchmarks.

**Research platform potential:** the source-partitioned retrieval + trust-calibration architecture generalizes beyond scientific QA to any domain with retrievable ground-truth-adjacent evidence (legal reasoning against case law, medical reasoning against clinical literature) — worth noting as a scope-expansion direction, not claimed as current contribution.

**Startup potential:** lower priority for this specific mechanism (the evaluation harness is more broadly useful than the trust mechanism as a standalone product), but a "trustworthy multi-agent reasoning API" framing is plausible if the mechanism generalizes well across domains in follow-up work.

**Long-term trust memory:** already named in the original proposal's future-directions FAQ (cross-session trust memory, multimodal evidence grounding, domain-specific calibration) — preserved unchanged here as the canonical list.

---

## Section 18 — Final Critical Review (Reviewer #2 Mode)

**Challenging every assumption, as an adversarial reviewer would:**

**On the core mechanism:**

- _"Your trust formula has two free hyperparameters (α, β) — how do I know you didn't just tune them until the result looked good?"_ — Mitigated by the existing hyperparameter sensitivity analysis (grid search, CCR varies <4% across configs) — but ensure this section is prominent in the paper, not buried in an appendix, since it's a first-line reviewer question.
- _"Propositions 2–3 aren't real theorems — why call them Propositions at all?"_ — Already correctly reframed as "design properties, not global convergence theorems" — this is the right call, but expect at least one reviewer to push on this framing regardless; have the honest answer ready rather than over-defending the math.
- _"Is 20–30% CCR reduction actually a big number, or is it modest window-dressing?"_ — Needs a sentence in the paper contextualizing this against the baseline collapse rate (~45%) so readers understand the relative, not just absolute, magnitude.

**Missing experiments/evaluations a sharp reviewer might demand:**

- **Latency/cost-benefit analysis:** the system runs ~9 forward passes vs. 1 for single-agent. A reviewer will ask "is the accuracy gain worth 9x the compute?" — this isn't currently a headline metric. **Recommend adding a compute-cost-vs-CCR-reduction table** as a supplementary result before final submission.
- **Robustness to paraphrased injection templates:** currently named as a known protocol limitation (L2) but not tested. If time allows in Phase 4's buffer month, even a small (20–30 question) paraphrase-robustness check would meaningfully strengthen the paper against the "your injection template is too easy to detect" objection.
- **Sensitivity to K (number of debate rounds):** N-scaling is planned, but K is fixed at 3 throughout. A reviewer may ask whether results are an artifact of this specific round count.

**Missing datasets:** none flagged as critical — the current set (BrokenMath, BrokenArXiv, HLE, GPQA, MMLU-Pro) is well-justified and appropriately adversarial-vs-stable balanced.

**Possible reviewer criticisms, ranked by likely severity:**

1. **"How is this meaningfully different from iMAD's confidence-weighted aggregation?"** — Already the paper's designed strongest-result sentence; ensure the "external evidence vs. same-context confidence signal" distinction is stated in the first paragraph of the results section, not just the related work.
2. **"Your injection protocol is artificially explicit — real sycophancy is subtler."** — Already acknowledged (Limitation L1) as an honest upper-bound scenario; this should be stated early and confidently, not defensively.
3. **"Two of your four core citations aren't peer-reviewed."** — Addressed via the proactive-disclosure approach already established; ensure this same framing appears in the paper's related-work section, not just the supervisor meeting.

**Proposal defense questions to prepare (beyond the original Section 11 FAQ, which remains valid):**

- "What's your actual Go/No-Go criterion if the Month-1 pilot shows the trust signal doesn't behaviorally matter?" — **This needs an explicit answer before the meeting.** Suggested answer: fall back to reporting the pilot's negative result honestly as a finding about _when_ evidence-grounded trust does/doesn't influence LLM aggregation behavior — this reframes a possible negative result as still-publishable knowledge, consistent with the project's "result-neutral milestones" philosophy already established in the original timeline.

**Mid-defense and final-defense question themes:** expect deeper probing on the iMAD reimplementation fidelity (since it's the highest-effort, highest-scrutiny component) and on whether the human evaluation sample (n=60) is large enough for the claimed statistical power — have a brief power-analysis justification ready.

**Journal reviewer concerns (if targeting TMLR/Findings):** primary concern will likely be generalization beyond the three specific chosen model families — pre-empt with a sentence in limitations acknowledging this is inherent to any finite-agent-pool study, consistent with the "Scope Boundaries" section already present in the original proposal.

**Recommended pre-implementation actions, in priority order:**

1. Finalize the Month-1 pilot's explicit Go/No-Go criterion (flagged above) — do this before Phase 0 begins.
2. Add the compute-cost-vs-CCR-reduction table to the planned evaluation outputs.
3. If Phase 4's buffer month has slack, add the paraphrase-robustness spot-check.
4. Prepare the proactive citation-status disclosure for the next supervisor meeting (already scripted in earlier discussion).

---

**Blueprint complete.** All 18 sections are internally consistent with every previously validated design decision — trust formula, baseline set, dataset selection, timeline, and publication-status corrections carried through without contradiction. The only net-new additions introduced across this blueprint (beyond organizing existing decisions) are: the Month-1 behavioral-effectiveness pilot with an explicit Go/No-Go criterion, the OpenAlex retrieval fallback, and three reviewer-anticipation additions (compute-cost table, paraphrase-robustness check, K-sensitivity awareness) — each flagged with rationale rather than silently inserted, per your original instructions.
